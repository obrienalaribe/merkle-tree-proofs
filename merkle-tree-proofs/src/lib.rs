// NOTE: As the README outlines, your exam will be graded with some unit tests that will be
// executed as a [integration tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/integration_testing.html)
// included in this repository.
//
// This has some important implications:
//
// 1. Do not make anything private.
// 2. Do not change the name/signature of any function.
// 3. Be aware that your macros are going to be executed in different file!
//
// The tests in each module `module_name` will import:
// `use pba_assignment::*;`
// `use pba_assignment::module_name::*;`
